## Project Description
The **Self-Development Hub** is a personal growth platform designed to help users build routines, explore productive hobbies, and become the best version of themselves. With a variety of motivational content, interactive tools, and personalization options, this website creates a unique, supportive space for self-improvement.

## Key Features
User Authentication (Login/Logout): A simple login and logout functionality that saves user session data locally, ensuring users can return where they left off without re-entering their credentials.

**Daily Affirmations and Advice**: A collection of motivational quotes and practical advice to help users stay positive and engaged in their self-improvement journey.
**Light/Dark Mode**: A day/night mode toggle allows users to choose between light and dark themes, with the selected theme saved in local storage, persisting between sessions.

**Content Filtering**: Personalized filters let users sort content according to their preferences, such as selecting specific categories or topics. These settings are saved in local storage, so users return to a personalized view every time.

**Fun Interaction**: Beside useful content, we do not need to forget to have some fun. Sad Hamster will raise up your mood, but also just mood vibe.

**Social Media Links**: Dedicated section with links to Kozqarshigiâ€™s social media accounts, allowing users to connect, follow, and reach out on different platforms.
